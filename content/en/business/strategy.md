### 1. Thorough Departure from and Optimization of "Heavy IT Assets"

We will rigorously shift from ownership to usage, aiming for a lean and agile IT environment.

* Eliminate unnecessary IT assets and migrate to the cloud:
  We will actively retire aging, low-value, or high-maintenance on-premises systems and accelerate the transition to cloud services such as SaaS and PaaS. This reduces upfront investments and operational costs while improving IT asset efficiency.

* ROI-focused IT investments:
  When introducing new systems or upgrading existing ones, we will rigorously assess their contribution to the business and ROI as IT assets. We will uphold the principle of not owning low-efficiency IT assets.

* Liquidation of assets:
  IT assets with declining value or infrastructure that does not align with our core competencies will be outsourced or shared externally to keep the IT portfolio lean and efficient.

### 2. Transition to IT as a Service and a "Post-Use Revenue" Model

We will shift our focus from IT systems themselves to delivering business value through IT.

* IT services as "business continuity guarantees":
  Beyond system maintenance, our top mission is to ensure that business operations never stop. We will adopt predictive maintenance, proactive monitoring, and automation to guarantee continuous business operations.

* Commitment to customer success:
  In addition to incident response, we will provide consulting and data analytics services that directly contribute to improving operational efficiency and productivity, building long-term partnerships through continuous value delivery.

* Revenue contribution through digital services:
  We will explore service models in which IT directly generates revenue, such as data analytics services and automation solutions, transforming IT from a cost center into a profit center.

### 3. Strategic IT Portfolio Optimization and Focus

We will concentrate resources on core IT systems that underpin business competitiveness.

* Clarify "IT strengths":
  We will identify where to build competitive advantage and where to focus IT investments, such as data analytics platforms and IT areas that will drive future growth.

* Strategic outsourcing of non-core IT:
  Generic IT functions and heavy IT systems will be actively outsourced to specialized external partners, allowing us to focus internal resources on value creation.

* Flexible IT governance for business restructuring:
  To prepare for potential future business portfolio optimization (e.g., divestitures, spin-offs), we will promote loosely coupled architectures and standardization, enabling IT systems to flexibly support business separation and integration.

### 4. Deep Integration into Business Operations through DX

We will drive IT strategies that are integrated with business operations.

* Deep understanding of customer workflows:
  IT personnel will immerse themselves in the business units to thoroughly understand their processes, challenges, and needs. Together with business units, we will co-create optimal digital solutions from their perspective.

* Support for data-driven decision-making:
  By collecting and analyzing operational process data, we will help business units make data-driven decisions through predictive maintenance and consulting services.

* Accelerating value transformation through IT:
  We will work jointly with business units to develop new service models and transform business processes using digital technologies, positioning IT as a driver of business transformation.
