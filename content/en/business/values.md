### 1. Maximize Efficiency:

We constantly eliminate waste and seek ways to generate the greatest impact with the smallest IT assets and resources.

### 2. Focus on Value Creation:

We always ask whether everything we do directly contributes to the business and improves profitability, and we commit thoroughly to delivering results.

### 3. Co-create with Business:

We regard our customers—the business units, operations teams, and maintenance teams—as true partners. We deeply share their challenges and goals, and create solutions together through the power of IT.

### 4. Embrace Transformation:

Without settling for the status quo, we continuously explore new technologies and approaches, proactively driving business transformation through IT.
