## Building a Resilient IT Infrastructure and Operations to Remain a Business Partner Who Shapes the Future

We are committed to thoroughly implementing the "asset-light" philosophy in the field of IT operations and maintenance. By pursuing the principle of "creating maximum business value with minimal capital, without burdening ourselves with heavy IT assets," we aim for IT to become a strategic engine that drives sustained high growth and profitability for our business.
