* **Real-Time Dashboard**: Key KPIs such as ROIC, revenue growth rate, operating profit margin, and service revenue ratio are continuously visualized and made accessible online to management and stakeholders.
* **Periodic Reports**: Detailed reports are prepared monthly and quarterly, shared via an online platform, and clearly state year-on-year comparisons, target deviations, and improvement plans.
* **Review**: Instead of holding meetings, each responsible person reviews and comments independently based on reports and dashboards.
* **Escalation Rules**: If any KPI falls below defined thresholds, improvement plans are immediately prepared, shared online, and notified to management.
