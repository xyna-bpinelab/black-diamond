## Pursuit of Asset-Light and High Capital Efficiency

We minimize the IT assets required for business operations and maximize the use of scalable, flexible external services. We thoroughly ensure the efficiency of maintenance and operations, consistently pursuing improved ROI.

## "Service-First" Mindset

We position "ensuring our customers' operations never stop" as the most important value, rather than focusing solely on systems themselves. All metrics and improvement activities are directly linked to business continuity and operational quality.

## Transparent and Consistent Metric Management

We publish KPIs and operational results in a timely manner and share them openly. Evaluation criteria are clarified, and data for continuous improvement is consistently accumulated and analyzed.

## Balance of Resilience and Long-Term Perspective

We operate with both risk tolerance and growth potential in mind, maintaining sustainable high performance not only in annual targets but also over the medium to long term.
